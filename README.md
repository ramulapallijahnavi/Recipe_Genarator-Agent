# 🧑‍🍳 Recipe Preparation Agent

The **Recipe Preparation Agent** is an AI-powered assistant that helps users find and prepare recipes through natural language queries. Built entirely on **IBM Cloud**, it uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach to combine relevant recipe data with generative AI for precise and helpful responses.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

- 🔍 Retrieve recipes based on ingredients, names, or user questions
- 🧠 Uses RAG architecture for smart and accurate answers
- 🗂️ Recipes stored in IBM Cloudant (NoSQL)
- 🧾 Step-by-step preparation guidance
- ☁️ Fully integrated with IBM Watsonx, Cloudant, and Cloud Functions

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **IBM Watsonx.ai** – Agentic AI orchestration
- **IBM Cloudant** – NoSQL database for recipe storage
- **IBM Cloud Functions** – Serverless backend logic
- **Python** – Programming language for backend development

---


## 🚀 How It Works

1. User sends a natural language query (e.g., "How to make pasta with mushrooms?")
2. The system retrieves relevant recipes from Cloudant
3. A generative AI model (via Watson) forms a response combining data + context
4. The user receives a step-by-step guide to prepare the recipe

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Voice support using IBM Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech
- Personalized suggestions based on user preferences
- Multilingual recipe responses
- Integration with smart kitchen devices
